# Working on BigMoeOnEdge (agent guide)

Read this before making changes. It captures the invariants that keep this project clean.
It follows the [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) convention, so any coding agent picks it up;
`CLAUDE.md` just points here.

## What this is

A ports-and-adapters engine that streams MoE experts from flash so >RAM models run on
device, built **on top of** llama.cpp's public API. The whole value proposition is that
we do not fork llama.cpp. See `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/seam.md`.

## Project map

- `core/include/bmoe/` — ports (interfaces) + config. Pure policy, no llama.cpp include.
- `core/src/io/` — `platform_io` (cross-platform O_DIRECT reads + reserve/commit/evict VM);
  `file_reader` (pooled positioned reader, per-consumer O_DIRECT — used by both the expert stream
  and the dense loader).
- `core/src/moe/` — `gguf_offsets`, `arch_registry`, `expert_stream_source`, `router_hook`;
  `dense_weights` (the non-expert weight policy: mmap / warm / anon, plus the residency sensor).
- `core/src/engine/runtime.cpp` — composition + greedy generation loop.
- `cli/main.cpp` — `bmoe-cli`; the ONLY place environment variables are read.
- `third_party/llama.cpp` — stock upstream submodule.
- `tests/` — byte-identity gates. `examples/android/` — the demo APK.

## Build and test

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
scripts/build-host.sh
cd build && ctest --output-on-failure         # byte-identity gates (needs python3 + gguf)
```

Android CLI: `pwsh scripts/build-android.ps1` (needs the NDK), then build the APK in
`examples/android`.

## Hard rules

1. **Never patch llama.cpp in-tree.** Everything goes through the public eval-callback and
   public gguf/model APIs. If a change seems to need a llama.cpp edit, stop and discuss —
   the fallback is a *separate* 1-commit fork branch on `Helldez/llama.cpp`, never an
   in-tree diff, and only after agreement. Upgrading llama.cpp must stay a submodule bump.
2. **Repack stays off.** The engine loads with `use_mmap=true, use_extra_bufts=false`.
   The streamer rebinds `tensor->data` to the native gguf layout; repacking breaks it.
   This is load-bearing, not a tunable.
3. **No env vars in the library.** `core/` never calls `getenv`. Config flows through
   `RunConfig`; the CLI resolves any env overrides before building it.
4. **No hardcoding.** New architectures are recipe rows in `arch_registry.cpp`; expert
   counts, strides and offsets are discovered at runtime. No model-specific constants in
   the streaming path.
5. **Gates must pass before merge.** `bmoe_moe_gates` proves streamed == resident. If you
   touch the streamer, the seam, or bump the submodule, run them.
6. **Docs and changelog ship with the change.** Every PR updates `CHANGELOG.md` and the docs
   it invalidates, in the same PR — never as a later sweep. A release gets its own dated
   `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section; nothing accumulates under `[Unreleased]`. Check in
   particular: the README benchmark tables and model list, the `docs/architecture.md` layer
   map, `docs/seam.md` when the llama.cpp boundary moves, `docs/telemetry.md` when CSV
   columns or the `BMOE_*` protocol change, `docs/roadmap.md` when a listed future item
   ships, and `examples/android/README.md` when the catalog, settings or build flow change.
   Docs that name a file the code no longer has are worse than no docs.
7. **Protocol selection is explicit.** GPT-OSS and Qwen Agent behavior is a user-selectable, persisted and
   visible configuration. Runtime code must not infer protocol roles, thinking mode or tool-template behavior
   from a model filename or model identity. Any new protocol profile must include a minimal unit test for its
   role and execution parameters.
8. **Keep security and tests proportional.** Do not expand work with separate security hardening or broad
   security review unless the user explicitly requests it. For each change, retain only the minimal tests
   needed to verify the changed behavior; do not add broad scenario coverage by default.
9. **Review exactly what is being published, every time.** This repo is public and every push
   is permanent record. Before any commit, push, PR or release: run `git status --short` and
   stage by explicit path only — never `git add -A` / `git add .`; untracked files in the
   working tree are not yours to publish. Logs, CSVs and bench evidence get a scan for
   identifying data (device model codes, local paths, addresses) before landing in `docs/`;
   phrase the test device generically. After a squash-merge, verify the landed tree
   (`git ls-tree`) before pushing anything else.

## Conventions

- **Commits:** Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`,
  `build:`, `ci:`, `chore:`). Author is **Helldez only** — do NOT add AI co-author or
  session trailers to commits.
- **Group commits.** One commit = one coherent change. Never a commit for a trivial
  tweak on its own — fold small fixes, doc touches and follow-ups into the change they
  belong to. If several small things accumulate, batch them into one commit.
- **Delete the branch when its PR closes** — merged or rejected, local and remote
  (`git branch -d`, `git push origin --delete`). A branch list should only show work in
  flight. Nothing is lost on a rejected PR: GitHub keeps its commits reachable from the
  closed PR itself.
- **Language:** all code, comments, docs, and commit messages in English.
- **Style:** `.clang-format` (LLVM base, 4-space, 120 col). CI checks with
  **clang-format 18**; match that version locally (`pip install clang-format==18.*`) or
  formatting that looks clean can still fail the check.
- Comments explain *why* / invariants, not *what*.
- **No milestone codenames** (M0…Mn) in docs — describe capabilities thematically.

## Releases

- **Release APKs come from CI, never from a local build.** The `release-apk` workflow runs
  when a release is published: clean checkout of the tag, NDK build, signed with the stable
  key from repository secrets, assets attached to the release. Do not hand-upload an APK.
- **Every released feature bumps the app version**: `versionCode` + `versionName` in the
  Android app's Gradle config, in the same PR as the change being released, matching the tag.
- **Release title is the bare version** — `vX.Y.Z`, no description after it.
- **Validate on device before releasing.** The host gates prove correctness, not speed or
  app behaviour; a release that changes the engine or the app gets a run on a real phone
  first.

## Where numbers come from

Benchmark figures in the docs are measured (12 GB / UFS 4.x test phone,
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M and friends). Don't invent or round them silently; if you re-measure,
update `docs/benchmark-method.md` and the README table together. Phrase the test device
generically in anything public.
