# Roadmap

Themes, not deadlines. Ordered roughly by expected impact.

The starting point has moved: with a well-sized expert cache and `--overlap`, decode on the
reference device is **compute-bound, not I/O-bound**. Flash I/O is ~79 % of decode only with the
cache off; at Qwen's cache 4000 it inverts, and an infinite cache would still cap at 1/compute
≈ 6.2 tok/s — this SoC's in-RAM decode speed ([benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md#reading-the-numbers)).
So the streaming path has already recovered most of what streaming can recover, and the themes
below are ordered by that fact: read bandwidth still matters for the models that do not fit a
useful cache, but throughput on the ones that do now depends on compute.

## On-device Agent exploration — local tools and community discovery

The Android app now has a dedicated Chinese Agent workspace and a persistent toolkit catalog.
Network diagnostics, device exploration, log analysis, performance observation and model-catalog
groups can be enabled independently; entering the workspace no longer starts a run implicitly.
The user confirms each task, and the Agent keeps its transcript and observation trail separate from
ordinary chat. Selecting a loaded model starts the confirmed local turn, and the Agent may request
only the bounded read-only observations exposed by those selected groups. Results are optimized for
both sides of the interface: the model gets structured JSON while the human sees a compact summary
and can expand raw data.
The community page fetches ModelScope's public model trend endpoint, displays source-provided rank,
download, like and update metadata, and leaves installation explicit. No root, daemon, shell or
second model runtime is needed on the test device.

## On-device tuning — measurement infrastructure

The Android app now provides a bounded, recommendation-only comparison for the remaining
configuration uncertainty. It tests the current settings plus one cache rung and two I/O-lane rungs,
twice each in balanced order, with fresh sessions and a short thermal cooldown. The candidate set
changes no inference-quality or lossy knob, and every trial's engine CSV carries the resolved
configuration. The app compares greedy text, records temperature availability and writes an
`autotune-*.csv` audit; it does not claim a speedup or silently apply a result. This is the next
useful step because the existing evidence shows cache and lane choices are device/model dependent,
while prior experiments already ruled out broad engine changes without matched on-device data.


This section used to open by asserting that effective O_DIRECT bandwidth sits well below the
drive's ceiling *because the routed slices are scattered*. That premise was measured on
2026-07-20 with `tools/bmoe-iobench` and **does not hold on the reference device**
([bench-data/2026-07-20-cache-replay/iobench-ceiling.md](bench-data/2026-07-20-cache-replay/iobench-ceiling.md)):

- Random O_DIRECT reads **saturate at 2 lanes** (~2460 MiB/s cold); 8, 16 and 32 lanes are
  flat-to-worse while latency grows linearly. `io_threads_max = 8` is already past the knee.
- Bandwidth is **flat above ~256 KiB** per read (2100-2550 MiB/s). Expert slices are MiB-class,
  so scatter costs little: only sub-256 KiB reads lose throughput.

What follows from that:

- **Read coalescing of adjacent routed slices at runtime — not worth building.** For it to pay,
  a layer's routed experts would have to land on consecutive ids. Measured over the committed
  route traces they do so **0.6 % of the time on gpt-oss and ~4 % on Qwen/Gemma**; an ideal
  coalescer removes 4 % of the read *count* and zero bytes.
- **Expert-contiguous layout — re-justified, built, and measured NEGATIVE (2026-07-20).** The
  re-justification came back genuinely positive at the drive level (`bmoe-iobench --scatter`:
  sub-MiB scattered pieces plateau ~10% under the ceiling; "flat above 256 KiB" held only at
  saturating lane counts), and a full sidecar implementation passed every byte-identity gate —
  but on device it wins only in the serial cache-off regime (+16%), and **loses 20-23% in every
  shipping configuration** (overlap + cache, LFM2.5 and Qwen3-30B k=8): the overlap kernel
  consumes projection-major and a whole-entry read triples the latency to an expert's first
  slice, so the pipeline stalls. Bandwidth is not the binding constraint; latency-to-ready is.
  Closed unmerged (PR #90, tag `expert-sidecar-refuted`); full data in
  [bench-data/2026-07-20-sidecar/findings.md](bench-data/2026-07-20-sidecar/findings.md).
- **Reading a slice straight into the cache buffer — blocked by the gguf's own offsets
  (2026-07-28).** Every streamed byte is pulled into a per-lane bounce buffer and then memcpy'd to
  its cache slot, so the CPU touches it twice; at 100-200 MB/token that copy is not free, and it
  lands on the I/O lanes, which under overlap run alongside a decode that is already compute-bound.
  Skipping it needs the read to be block-aligned at all three of offset, length and destination.
  Measured on the three shipped models: **bytes-per-expert is 4096-aligned, the tensor's file
  offset is not** — 512 (Qwen3-30B), 1152 (Qwen3.6-35B), 2272 (gpt-oss-120b) — because gguf aligns
  tensor data to `general.alignment` (32), not to a device block. So an O_DIRECT window must round
  outward and always spills one block into the *neighbouring experts'* bytes.

  Writing that spill is content-identical (the cache buffer mirrors the file layout), but it is not
  safe here: those pages belong to other cache entries, which may have been evicted, and touching
  them would fault a page back with nothing accounting for it — putting the residency budget out of
  step with what is actually resident. The trick that would make it work (offsetting each buffer's
  base by `file_off % align` so the destination inherits the file's misalignment) does not remove
  the spill, only its size. Not built: the win is a memcpy, the risk is the memory accounting the
  whole engine's budget rests on, and it cannot be judged without a device.
- The remaining gap between the engine's effective rate and the drive's is **duty cycle, not
  bandwidth**, and is not yet honestly sized: the ceiling itself falls by a third once the device
  is hot, so engine and microbench must be measured interleaved at matched entry state. Owed.

## Warm-up

Dense weights default to `--dense-weights anon` — read once through O_DIRECT into anonymous
memory, which is what actually removes the >RAM fault storm; the page-cache `warm` policy holds
only near RAM, since past it the kernel reclaims the warmed pages back out from under the run
([warmup-analysis.md](warmup-analysis.md)). The expert cache still fills from cold, so the first
tokens pay for it and no warm-up flag can change that. Worth exploring: preloading experts by
routing frequency rather than by arrival, and a cross-run persistent cache so a second session
starts warm.

Frequency **is** the signal to preload on, and that is now measured rather than assumed: over the
committed route traces, predicting a token's experts from the run's hottest list is right 26.7 %
of the time on gpt-oss against 17.9 % for the previous token's routing. But note what the same
session found about *spending* memory work to exploit it — see the expert-cache theme below.

Keeping the dense weights resident once they are in has no lever in
[android-memory.md](android-memory.md) — except one, found on 2026-07-21: a **dma-buf allocated
through `AHardwareBuffer`** is exempt from reclaim by construction and needs no privilege. Its
bandwidth gate passes cleanly (1.00× against anonymous memory; usable in 2047 MiB units, an
`AHardwareBuffer_lock` boundary at 2^31 bytes —
[bench-data/2026-07-21-pinned-memory/](bench-data/2026-07-21-pinned-memory/findings.md)). What is
`--dense-weights ahwb` implements it, and the in-app A/B came back **positive: +17.9% on a long
generation, confidence intervals disjoint**, with `dense_resident_frac` pinned at exactly 1.000
([bench-data/2026-07-21-pinned-dense-ab/](bench-data/2026-07-21-pinned-dense-ab/findings.md)).

The mechanism is not the predicted one, and that correction is the more valuable half. Major faults
are *equal* between the modes: `anon` already keeps the dense weights off the flash. What it does
not prevent is the kernel taking ~15% of them into **zram**, where a later touch is a minor fault
plus a decompression — a cost that appears in no I/O or fault counter and lands in `compute_ms`.
So **`compute_ms` has been absorbing swap-in all along**, and any earlier "this regime is
compute-bound" conclusion deserves re-examination. Making that cost visible (minor faults, swap-in
time) is worth more than the next few percent of throughput.

Still open: the reversed-order pair (`ahwb` ran first in the decisive pair), and anything beyond one
device / model / config — hence default off. **Not** worth extending to the expert cache without
sizing the prize first: under `ahwb` only ~294 MiB of a 3000 MiB budget sits in zram, so the prize
is a fraction of the dense one while the cost — 3 GiB of rigid, LMK-accounted memory, and the loss
of the reserve/commit/evict elasticity the cache is built on — is far higher.

## Expert cache policy — closed, negatively

Whether a smarter eviction policy could raise throughput is **answered, and the answer is no**
([bench-data/2026-07-20-cache-replay/](bench-data/2026-07-20-cache-replay/)).

Offline replay of the route traces through Bélády, LRU, LFU, random and a per-layer partition
(`scripts/route-replay.py`, validated against the recorded hit rates to the decimal) shows the
offline optimum is 11-23 points above LRU, but **no online policy recovers more than ~5**. The
best candidate, a per-layer budget partition with frequency eviction, was implemented under the
tag `experiment/layer-lfu` and measured: it delivers the predicted hit-rate gain
(+2.0 points, −7 % flash reads) and is **~30 % slower**, because a hard per-layer cap removes the
cache's ability to self-balance and the resulting `MADV_DONTNEED` churn gets paid for by the
kernel reclaiming the dense weights (majflt/token 6 → 2370). It is preserved under that tag rather
than merged — a measured regression does not belong in the engine.

The transferable lesson: a hit-rate curve is not a throughput argument. Any future policy has to
be measured on device, however good its simulation.

What is still worth doing here is **not** a policy but a guard. Global LRU's recency order is
anti-correlated with the deterministic layer cycle, so below one token cycle it evicts precisely
what it is about to read and the hit rate goes to **exactly 0 %** — reproduced on device at a
budget the CLI accepts today. The worst-case cycle is computable at init from model shape alone,
so refusing or warning on a budget under it costs almost nothing.

## More architectures

`qwen3moe`, `qwen2moe`, `qwen35moe` (the hybrid attention/SSM family, e.g. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B),
`gemma4` (merged `ffn_gate_up_exps` plus shared experts) and OpenAI `gpt-oss` (MXFP4, purely
routed) are supported; other `build_moe_ffn` models are one recipe row each. The remaining
frontier is architectures whose routing node is not the shared `ffn_moe_topk` — custom gating,
which the capture/stream hook would need to learn. See [adding-a-model.md](adding-a-model.md).

## Skipping reads the router barely wants — built, unmeasured

`--drop-cold-experts` ([expert-dropping.md](expert-dropping.md)) is the first lever that treats
quality and I/O as a *joint* budget rather than two separate knobs: an expert already in the cache
runs however small its weight, and only a routing that would cost a flash read can be dropped. On
the recorded traces that is worth ~3× the reads of turbo top-k for a comparable weight cost, which
is the strongest offline case any remaining lever has shown.

What it does **not** have is a device measurement, and the previous entry on this page is the reason
that matters: `layer-lfu` simulated well and was ~30% slower in reality. The open questions are the
device A/B against turbo top-k at matched throughput, the quality comparison at that speed, and how
far the static replay overstated the win once dropping starts changing what the cache holds.

## Expert quantization on the fly

Storing streamed experts at a lower precision than the resident parts to cut read volume, if it
can stay within an acceptable quality boundary. Most valuable exactly where read bandwidth still
binds, above.

## Bigger, smarter cache

The cache is capacity-bound, not policy-bound (reuse is broad, not skewed), so the simplest win is
more budget — which `--cache-mb auto` now takes automatically, capped by `--cache-ceil-mb`
([cache-sizing.md](cache-sizing.md)). Admission policies and a persistent cross-run cache
remain unexplored.

## Not on this list

Routing prediction and speculative expert gating were built and **removed**: the recall/latency
trade never paid on-device, and the predictor coupled the streamer to model internals, which cost
more in modularity than it returned in throughput. The archived measurements are in
[bench-data/2026-07-12-pr23/](bench-data/2026-07-12-pr23/).

**Reading a routing early is now measured, and it does not buy throughput either.** The question
was reopened with a predictor that costs no training and no model coupling — run the *next* layer's
router matrix on the *current* layer's gate input, which `--predict-log` scores against the
previous-token bet and against a zero-staleness control ([expert-prediction.md](expert-prediction.md)).
The accuracy is real: **88.6%** of routed slots on Qwen3-30B and **80.7%** on Qwen3.6-35B, against
43.3% / 35.4% for the incumbent, with the control at exactly 100% on every layer. Acting on it is
what fails. In thermally matched pairs, reading ahead on that prediction **lost 21%** in the
shipping drop + pinned-dense configuration with its hit rate *up* 4.3 points and 79% of speculations
useful — the same mechanism that killed more lanes, coalescing and the sidecar: on a saturated
flash, a better guess still spends bandwidth that was the binding constraint. The half that spends
nothing — retaining predicted residents against eviction — moved the hit rate by 0.4 points at a
3000 MiB cache, inside the ~5-point ceiling the offline replay already put on the whole class.
`--predict-prefetch` ships off by default, and the app defaults its budget to retention-only. What
would change the answer is a device where flash is *not* the constraint, or a predictor that reaches
layer 0 — which needs a trained per-layer artifact, a different project from this one.
