// A persistent engine session: load the model and warm the expert cache ONCE, then serve
// many prompts against that resident state.
//
// run() (runtime.h) is the one-shot convenience — it opens a Session, generates once, and
// closes. Session exists for the interactive case: a fresh process per prompt re-pays the
// model load (tens of seconds) and the whole expert-cache warm-up ramp every time, which is
// exactly what streaming was meant to avoid. Keeping the process alive amortises both:
//
//   auto s = Session::open(cfg, err);          // model load + capture + source.init, once
//   s->generate({.prompt = "..."});            // prefill + decode; cache survives
//   s->generate({.prompt = "..."});            // starts warm — no reload, no cold ramp
//
// This header is pure policy (no llama.cpp types) — the native state lives behind a pimpl,
// so the CLI and tests link it without pulling in the backend headers.
