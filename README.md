---

A Mixture-of-Experts model is made of many small "experts", and each generated token only uses a
few of them. BigMoeOnEdge takes that literally: it keeps the small always-needed part of the model
at hand and reads just the experts each token asks for, directly from flash storage, at the moment
they are needed. The rest of the model stays on disk. That is what lets a model several times
bigger than your RAM generate text on an ordinary phone, losslessly: the output is byte-identical
to running the same model fully resident.

It is built **on top of llama.cpp's public API**, not as a fork. Every quantization format,
tokenizer and chat template llama.cpp supports works out of the box, because llama.cpp itself is
doing that part: MXFP4 and Q4_K_M stream through the same code. Supporting a new MoE architecture
is one row in a registry, and following a new llama.cpp release is a routine submodule bump.

The most extreme thing it can do today: **DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731**, a 284B-parameter MoE
(~91 GB on disk at 2-bit expert quantization), generating on a phone with 12 GB of RAM at about
**1 tok/s**. More than seven times more model than memory, streamed from flash as the three shard
files Hugging Face ships, with no merge step and no PC in the loop.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/hero-dsv4.gif" width="360" alt="DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731 (284B, ~91 GB) generating in the demo app on a 12 GB phone, with live tok/s and telemetry"></p>

It is not one model, either. Below: three of them, one after another on the same phone, each past
what it should be able to hold.

## Why this exists

The models people actually want to talk to keep growing faster than the RAM in the devices they
carry. MoE models offer a way out, because most of their weights sit idle on any given token, but
every mainstream runtime still insists on holding (or paging) the whole file in memory. So a 20 GB
model on a 12 GB phone either refuses to load or crawls while the OS frantically swaps.

BigMoeOnEdge treats flash storage as part of the memory hierarchy instead. Three situations where
that changes what your device can run:

**Models far past RAM.** A ~60 GB model on a 12 GB phone cannot be resident, full stop. Streamed,
it runs at usable speed. This is the headline case, but it is not the only one.

**Models just past RAM.** An 18 to 22 GB model on a 12 GB phone is where the ordinary way of
loading (mmap) turns into a fault storm: the OS evicts weights as fast as it reads them, speed
swings wildly, other apps get killed. Streamed, the same model runs stably at up to 5 tok/s,
byte-identical output, and the rest of the phone stays alive.

**Models that barely fit.** Even a model that technically fits in RAM, say an 8B class MoE on a
phone with a few GB free, benefits: loaded the ordinary way it squeezes out everything else, and
the OS claws memory back mid-generation. Streamed with a capped cache, it runs inside a budget you
choose and leaves the system alone. And this is all plain CPU inference: no GPU, no NPU, four
cores and the phone's flash storage.

The same engine builds unmodified on desktop, where a model past RAM streams from the SSD out of
the box. Phones stay the focus, because that is where memory is tightest.

## Try it on your phone

No build needed. Install the APK from the
[latest release](https://github.com/Helldez/BigMoeOnEdge/releases/latest), open the **Get a
model** card, and tap one of the catalog entries: Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-IQ2_M (~44.4 GB),
Ling 3.0 Flash IQ2_M (~43.6 GB), Qwen3-30B-A3B (~18.6 GB),
Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct (~18.6 GB), Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (~22.3 GB),
Gemma-4-26B-A4B (~17 GB), gpt-oss-20b (~11.7 GB) or gpt-oss-120b MXFP4 (~63.4 GB from ModelScope).
The larger entries are past most phones' RAM. The catalog is only a
shortcut: the downloader takes any direct gguf URL, so any model from the
[supported architecture families](#supported-models) streams the same way. When the download
finishes, pick the model and chat. The telemetry panel shows tok/s and the compute-vs-flash
split live, and every streaming knob below is in Settings.

Models above Hugging Face's 50 GB per-file limit (gpt-oss-120b, DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731) ship as
multi-shard ggufs, and both are in the catalog: the app fetches the shards one after another,
resumable, under a single progress bar. The engine reads a split set natively, so there is no merge
step anywhere. Outside the catalog the rule is the same: put the shards in one directory and point
at the first (`-00001-of-...`).

## Features

Grouped the way the demo app groups them in Settings. Each row is one setting: the name the app
uses, the flag it maps to, and what it does. The app folds the experimental ones into a collapsed
group; here they are marked.

Streaming itself is the engine (`--moe-stream`): only the experts a token routes to are read, from
flash, at the moment they are needed. Everything below tunes that.

### Streaming

| Setting | Flag and values | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Expert cache | `--cache-mb` &nbsp;`auto`, `0`, `500` to `6000` MiB &nbsp;(app default `2000`) | Keeps the most-used experts in RAM. `auto` sizes it once at load from free memory; a fixed value is reproducible, which is why the app ships one. Below the engine's floor it only churns. |
| Cache ceiling | `--cache-ceil-mb` &nbsp;`0` (no cap), `2000` to `6000` | Caps what `auto` may claim. The OS counts our own mapped weights as free, so uncapped it can ask for more than exists. |
| Parallel I/O lanes | `--io-threads` &nbsp;`1`, `2`, `4`, `8` &nbsp;(default `4`) | Reads several expert slices at once. Helps until the flash saturates, which this engine's own measurements put at two lanes on the test device. |
| Direct I/O | `--no-odirect` disables it &nbsp;(on by default) | Bypasses the OS page cache, so the system holds no second copy of what the expert cache already has. Falls back where unsupported. |
| I/O and compute overlap | `--overlap` &nbsp;(off in the CLI, on in the app) | Issues the next reads while the current layer computes, hiding flash latency behind work. Byte-identical; needs a small optional add-on to llama.cpp ([seam](docs/seam.md)). |
| Dense weights | `--dense-weights` &nbsp;`mmap`, `warm`, `anon`, `ahwb` &nbsp;(default `anon`) | How the always-needed non-expert weights are held. Decisive far past RAM. `ahwb` is Android-only and puts them where the kernel cannot reclaim them at all ([data](docs/bench-data/2026-07-21-pinned-dense-ab/findings.md)). |
| Temporal prefetch *(experimental)* | `--prefetch` &nbsp;`0` (off), `1`, `2`, `4` layers | Bets a layer reuses the previous token's experts and fetches them on idle lanes. Needs the cache. |
| Predictive prefetch *(experimental)* | `--predict-prefetch`, with `--predict-spec-max` &nbsp;`0` (retention only), `1`, `2`, `4` | Runs the next layer's own router early and fetches what it names. More accurate than the bet above; reading ahead on it still lost its on-device A/B ([why](docs/expert-prediction.md)). |

### Speed and quality

| Setting | Flag and values | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Drop cold experts | `--drop-cold-experts` &nbsp;`0` (off) to `1.0`; app rungs `50%`, `75%`, `100%` &nbsp;(app default `75%`) | Skips a routed expert only when it is a cache miss *and* the router wanted it less than that share of an even split. Quality is spent only where it buys a read. Lossy and not reproducible: what is skipped depends on what the cache held. |
| Active experts | `--n-expert-used` &nbsp;`0` (model's own), `6`, `4`, `3`, `2` | Consults fewer experts per token than the model asks for, cutting compute and reads together. Lossy, but reproducible: the same prompt gives the same answer. |
| Guess ahead *(experimental)* | `--mtp` or `--ngram`, with `--draft` &nbsp;`1` to `5` &nbsp;and, for the head, `--mtp-p-min` &nbsp;`0`, `40%`, `60%`, `80%` | Drafts the next few tokens and verifies the group in one decode, keeping only what the model itself would have produced. Nothing is approximated. Wins when weights move once per group, loses when the wider verify widens each layer's read set ([mtp](docs/mtp.md), [ngram](docs/ngram.md)). |
| Route-ahead *(experimental)* | `--route-ahead` &nbsp;`0` (off), `1`, `2`, `4` layers | Commits a layer's routing that many layers early, so its reads start early and can never be wasted. Lossy: some slots route differently. Excludes both prefetchers and Guess ahead ([detail](docs/route-ahead.md)). |

Everything under Streaming changes *how* weights are fetched, never the math, so the answer is the
one the model would have given anyway. The settings in this section are different in kind: they
change *what* the model computes, and they are here because on a device far past its memory the
alternative is often not a slower answer but no answer at all.

They are not interchangeable. Reducing the active experts cuts the routing tail whether or not
those experts were already free to run from memory, and it does so identically every time. Dropping
cold experts spends quality only where it buys back a flash read, which is more surgical but makes
the answer depend on what the cache happened to hold, so the same prompt can come out differently.
Guessing ahead gives up nothing at all: it changes how many tokens a pass confirms, not what the
model computes.

Each one is measured rather than assumed, and the numbers live with the method that produced them:
[expert-dropping.md](docs/expert-dropping.md), [mtp.md](docs/mtp.md),
[ngram.md](docs/ngram.md), [route-ahead.md](docs/route-ahead.md). Judge any of them on your own
task before relying on it.

### Sessions and telemetry

The model stays loaded across chat turns, and every run can account for its own time: `--progress`
breaks each token into flash I/O, cache management and compute, next to the cache hit rate and
bytes read, and `--csv` adds the memory picture those numbers must be read against. The Android
app renders the same feed live while you chat. More under [Telemetry](#telemetry).

### Android demo app

[`examples/android`](examples/android) is a small chat app over the same engine: model downloader,
live telemetry panel, and every knob above in Settings with a one-line note on what it does.
Defaults are the measured winning recipe for a model near RAM.

## Supported models

| Architecture | Reference models | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen3moe` | Qwen3-30B-A3B and siblings | Shipped default, validated below |
| `qwen35moe` | Qwen3.6-35B-A3B and siblings | Hybrid attention/SSM stack; routed experts stream unchanged |
| `qwen2moe` | Qwen2 MoE family | Same layout as qwen3moe |
| `gemma4` | Gemma 4 MoE (e.g. 26B-A4B) | Fused expert layout, handled by its registry row |
| `gpt-oss` | OpenAI gpt-oss-20b / 120b | Purely routed; MXFP4 weights stream unchanged |
| `lfm2moe` | Liquid AI LFM2 / LFM2.5 MoE (e.g. 8B-A1B) | Hybrid conv/attention stack with leading dense blocks; those stay resident |
| `deepseek4` | DeepSeek V4 Flash (284B-A13B), validated on the 0731 release | V3.2-style routing (256 experts + shared); compressed attention is dense-side; ships multi-shard |
| `bailingmoe3` | Ling 3.0 (e.g. Ling-3.0-flash, 127B-A5B) | 512 routed experts + shared, biased top-k; hybrid KDA/MLA attention is dense-side |

Adding an architecture is one row in the registry; expert counts and layouts are discovered from
the model file at runtime, so nothing about a specific model is hardcoded in the streaming path.
Procedure: [docs/adding-a-model.md](docs/adding-a-model.md). `bmoe-cli --list-archs` prints the
compiled-in set.

## Benchmarks

All figures are measured, not modelled; all models are Q4_K_M.

> **About the numbers.** Measured on one device (12 GB RAM, 11.3 GB usable, UFS 4.x
> storage) over `adb shell`, 256-token greedy decode. Each number is the best observed for that
> configuration, and rows in a table can come from different benchmark sessions. Phone throughput
> moves a lot with device state (heat, free memory), so the same command can read lower. Full
> method and distributions: [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md).

**How to read the tables.** Each row is one configuration of the same model on the same phone.
*mmap baseline* is the same file loaded the ordinary way (no streaming), which is what the
streamed rows are compared against. *k* is how many experts each token routes to, i.e.
`n_expert_used` (set with `--n-expert-used`); each table shows the model's default width and,
where measured, a reduced *k*, the measured lossy setting. *Flash/token* is data read from storage
per generated token (lower means the cache is working) and *cache hit* is the share of expert
reads served from RAM instead of flash. Bold marks the best configuration for that model.

### gpt-oss-120b (Q4_K_M): ~60 GB on a 12 GB phone

| Setup | Active experts | Cache | Lanes | tok/s | Flash/token | Cache hit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| mmap baseline | 4 | n/a | n/a | 0.09 | n/a | n/a |
| streamed | 4 | off | 4 | 0.7 | 1817 MiB | n/a |
| streamed | 4 | 2000 MiB | 8 | 1.3 | 1292 MiB | 27% |
| streamed | 2 | off | 4 | 1.8 | 909 MiB | n/a |
| **streamed** | **2** | **2000 MiB** | **8** | **2.2** | **590 MiB** | **32%** |

All streamed rows use `--overlap --dense-weights anon --no-think`. The setting that unlocked this
model is `--dense-weights anon`: this far past RAM the phone keeps reclaiming the always-used
weights mid-generation, and moving them out of the page cache was worth **3.2×** by itself. Note
that `--no-think` disables the model's reasoning and costs quality at k=4; the full matrix and
quality notes are in [docs/benchmarks-gpt-oss.md](docs/benchmarks-gpt-oss.md).

### Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (Q4_K_M): 22.3 GB

A hybrid attention/SSM MoE (256 experts, top-8, 41 blocks): most layers are linear attention
(Gated Delta Net) rather than full attention, and the routed experts stream exactly like a plain
`qwen3moe`. At ~2× device RAM the mmap baseline collapses into a fault storm; streaming with the
dense weights kept out of the page cache (`--dense-weights anon`) runs it stably.

| Setup | Active experts | Cache | Lanes | tok/s | Flash/token | Cache hit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| mmap baseline | 8 | n/a | n/a | 0.1 unstable | n/a | n/a |
| streamed | 8 | 2000 MiB | 4 | 4.3 | 206 MiB | 56% |
| streamed | 8 | 3000 MiB | 4 | 5.0 | 144 MiB | 65% |
| streamed | 6 | 2000 MiB | 4 | 5.4 | 137 MiB | 60% |
| **streamed** | **6** | **3000 MiB** | **4** | **5.8** | **91 MiB** | **68%** |

All streamed rows use `--overlap --dense-weights anon`. A larger cache is the main lossless lever
(cache 3000 is worth +16% over 2000); the k=6 rows are the measured lossy option (turbo top-k, below),
worth a further ~16% by routing to six experts instead of eight. The lossless best here is cache
3000 at the model's own width, **5.0 tok/s**, output byte-identical to the resident model.

> Unlike the tables above, these Qwen3.6 figures are a single 96-token run rather than the
> 256-token best-of protocol: treat them as indicative, and not strictly comparable to the other
> models until re-measured under the full protocol.

### Qwen3-30B-A3B (Q4_K_M): 18.5 GB

| Setup | Active experts | Cache | Lanes | tok/s | Flash/token | Cache hit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| streamed | 8 | off | 4 | 1.7 | 1051 MiB | n/a |
| mmap baseline | 8 | n/a | n/a | 2.0 unstable | n/a | n/a |
| streamed | 8 | 2000 MiB | 4 | 2.4 | 480 MiB | 53% |
| streamed | 8 | 4000 MiB | 4 | 4.0 | 225 MiB | 76% |
| streamed | 6 | 4000 MiB | 4 | 5.0 | 165 MiB | 77% |
| **streamed** | **8** | **auto, cap 4000** | **4** | **5.2** | **225 MiB** | **76%** |

Cache size is the dominant lever here, and the auto-sized cache with a ceiling
([docs/cache-sizing.md](docs/cache-sizing.md)) is the winning recipe. The mmap baseline
averages ~2 tok/s but swings wildly token to token and evicts other apps. Turbo top-k (k=6) trades
a little quality for a further +24% over the model's own width.

### Gemma-4-26B-A4B (Q4_K_M): 17.0 GB

| Setup | Active experts | Cache | Lanes | tok/s | Flash/token | Cache hit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| mmap baseline | 8 | n/a | n/a | 0.4 | n/a | n/a |
| streamed | 8 | off | 4 | 1.6 | 904 MiB | n/a |
| streamed | 8 | 2000 MiB | 4 | 2.2 | 366 MiB | 58% |
| streamed, overlap | 8 | 2000 MiB | 4 | 2.8 | 365 MiB | 58% |
| streamed | 8 | 4000 MiB | 4 | 4.1 | 144 MiB | 82% |
| **streamed** | **6** | **4000 MiB** | **4** | **5.0** | **98 MiB** | **83%** |

Gemma keeps more of itself permanently resident, so the 4000 MiB cache fits only when enough RAM is
free at launch; cache 2000 + overlap is the dependable everyday setting on this device. Turbo top-k
(k=6) is the fastest here (+22%) but changes the output.

### What to expect in the app

The tables above are a benchmark protocol over `adb`, not a chat session. The demo app lands close:
the best gpt-oss config reads **1.9 tok/s** in the app against 2.2 over adb, about 13% below. The
gap is the protocol (short chat replies never fully warm the cache), not the app. The app's
telemetry panel reports the same fields as the CLI, so you can see it directly. Analysis:
[docs/warmup-analysis.md](docs/warmup-analysis.md).

### Desktop

**Not the primary target, for now.** The engine builds and runs unmodified on desktop and a model
past RAM streams from the SSD out of the box, but the tuning, the defaults and the measurement
protocol are all aimed at phones, because that is where memory is tightest and where the problem
this engine exists for actually bites. What follows is a snapshot, not a tuned configuration.

Measured on a Windows x86 laptop (8 cores, 16 GB RAM, dual-channel DDR4, NVMe SSD) with
Qwen3.6-35B-A3B at ~1.5× RAM, 256-token generations:

| Setup | Active experts | Cache | Lanes | tok/s | Flash/token | Cache hit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| streamed | 8 | auto | 4 | 4.8 | 74 MiB | 84% |
| streamed, drop 75% | 8 | auto | 4 | 6.8 | 23 MiB | 92% |
| **streamed, overlap, drop 75%** | **8** | **auto** | **4** | **7.3** | **24 MiB** | **92%** |

The interesting part is that the bottleneck **flips**: on the phone streamed decode is I/O-bound,
on this laptop it is DRAM-bandwidth-bound in compute (~0.11 s/token in every cell, so a ~9 tok/s
ceiling even at zero I/O). More io lanes, more compute threads and the ~3 GB/s NVMe are all
neutral; the levers that pay are the cache budget, cache-aware dropping and `--overlap`. Full
campaign, including the cache-auto confound that round 1 had to unwind:
[docs/bench-data/2026-07-24-desktop-qwen36](docs/bench-data/2026-07-24-desktop-qwen36/findings.md).

If the model fits in RAM, just run it resident.

### How this is tested, and where the numbers come from

Three kinds of evidence, kept apart on purpose: correctness is asserted, speed and quality are
measured, and neither is allowed to stand in for the other.

**Correctness is a gate, not a benchmark.** `ctest` runs byte-identity gates on a tiny synthetic MoE
model generated by [`scripts/make-tiny-moe.py`](scripts/make-tiny-moe.py): streaming only the routed
experts must produce output *identical* to running with every expert resident, and the same holds
across the LRU cache, evictions, the `--overlap` async path, temporal and predictive prefetch, the
dense-weight rebind, multi-turn sessions, and a split multi-shard model read across shard
boundaries. A lossy knob gets gates for its machinery
instead: that changing
where the engine loads did not itself change a byte, which is what separates "the plumbing is
correct" from "the setting is lossy".

**Speed is measured on device**, over `adb shell` or in the demo app, one variable at a time, with
the raw per-token CSVs committed under [`docs/bench-data/`](docs/bench-data) next to a `findings.md`
that states the caveats: run order, thermal state, and what the cell does *not* show. Confidence
intervals are bootstrapped over the per-token series rather than quoted from a single mean. Method:
[docs/benchmark-method.md](docs/benchmark-method.md).

**Quality, for the lossy settings, is checked against a public benchmark.** The
[cache-aware dropping check](docs/bench-data/2026-07-22-drop-quality/findings.md) uses 15 questions
taken verbatim from the **GSM8K** test split
([openai/grade-school-math](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math), MIT), with the grading rule
fixed before any output was read and every reply committed so the grading can be audited. Decoding
is greedy throughout, so there is no sampling noise: a difference between two cells is caused by the
setting, not by chance. At that sample size such a check rules out a collapse, not a subtle cost, and
the write-ups say so.

Anything not measured is named as unmeasured. That is the rule the roadmap's
[recorded negative results](docs/roadmap.md) exist to enforce: a simulation that predicted a win and
a device that then delivered a 30% loss is why nothing here is published on an argument alone.

## Quickstart

### Host (Linux, macOS, Windows)

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Helldez/BigMoeOnEdge.git
cd BigMoeOnEdge
scripts/build-host.sh

# stream a MoE model with a device-sized expert cache and 4 read lanes
build/cli/bmoe-cli -m Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M.gguf --moe-stream \
  --cache-mb auto --cache-ceil-mb 4000 --io-threads 4 -t 4 -n 48 \
  --chatml -p "Explain MoE routing."
```

For a model several × device RAM, the shape that produced the gpt-oss numbers is:

```bash
build/cli/bmoe-cli -m gpt-oss-120b-Q4_K_M.gguf --moe-stream --overlap \
  --dense-weights anon --cache-mb 2000 --io-threads 8 -t 4 -n 256 \
  --chatml --no-think -p "Explain MoE routing."
```

The model must live on a real filesystem (on Android `/data/local/tmp/...`, not `/sdcard`). Omit
`--moe-stream` for the plain mmap baseline. The byte-identity gates (streamed == resident) run with
`cd build && ctest --output-on-failure` (needs `python3` with the `gguf` package).

Platform status: Linux is exercised by CI (build + gates) and Windows is where the
[desktop numbers](#desktop) were measured. On Windows, build with CMake directly (Visual Studio
Build Tools); the script above is bash, and MSVC puts the binary in `build\cli\Release\bmoe-cli.exe`.
macOS builds from the same sources (the platform branches exist) but is not validated, and it has
no O_DIRECT, so direct reads fall back to buffered I/O there.

### Android

The demo app is in [`examples/android`](examples/android): build the CLI for arm64 with
`scripts/build-android.ps1`, build the APK, push a model. Settings expose every streaming knob with
a one-line note on what it does; defaults are the measured winning recipe for a model near RAM. For
a model several × RAM, switch the dense-weights policy to `anon` and give the cache a real budget.
A prebuilt debug APK is attached to each
[release](https://github.com/Helldez/BigMoeOnEdge/releases).

## How it works

The model loads file-backed, and the engine hooks llama.cpp's public evaluation callback. When a
layer picks its experts for the current token, the engine fetches exactly those slices from flash
just in time for the matmul, optionally caching the hottest ones and overlapping reads with
compute. No llama.cpp sources are modified. The one exception is the optional `--overlap` flag,
which needs a per-expert wait point inside the CPU MoE kernel that no public API exposes: it
carries a single ~25-line hook, as one commit on the fork branch `bmoe/expert-ready-hook`. The
hook is zero-cost when unregistered, everything else builds against stock upstream, and it is
dropped the moment upstream ships an equivalent. Design and the exact API contract:
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md), [docs/seam.md](docs/seam.md).

### Telemetry

A model streamed past RAM fails in ways that all look identical from outside: it's just slow. So
every run accounts for its own time. `--progress` breaks each token down into flash I/O, cache
management and compute, next to the cache hit rate and the bytes read; `--csv` adds the memory
picture those numbers have to be read against. The Android app renders the same feed live while you
chat, which is how you watch a phone quietly take its memory back mid-answer.

What makes it worth reading is that the engine is candid about its own numbers. Compute, in
particular, isn't measured: it's whatever time is left once the measured parts come out, so it
silently absorbs page faults and throttled cores. Rather than let that pass, the engine ships the
counters that pull the residual apart, and marks anything it couldn't measure as unmeasured instead
of quietly reporting zero. That candour extends to the headline: tok/s times the decode and nothing
else, so the sampling, detokenizing and rendering between one token and the next fall outside it;
the engine reports that time too, rather than letting work hide in the gap.

Every metrics file also states the run that produced it: the engine version and the full resolved
configuration, including whether the run was instrumented or sampled, because such a run is not a
benchmark run. Two files put side by side answer "which is faster" only if something says what
differed between them, and by the time a file is read the command line that made it is long gone.

When the per-token split isn't enough, two diagnostics go further: one records what the router
asked for on every token, the other times the compute graph node by node. Both perturb the run they
measure, and both say so.

## Documentation

[docs/](docs/README.md) is indexed by what you're trying to do: understand the design, extend it,
or reproduce the measurements. Most-wanted entry points:

- [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md): the layer map and the llama.cpp relationship.
- [docs/adding-a-model.md](docs/adding-a-model.md): supporting a new MoE architecture.
- [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md): measured results and
  [how they were produced](docs/benchmark-method.md).
- [docs/telemetry.md](docs/telemetry.md): the per-token line protocol, the CSV schema and the traces.
- [docs/android-memory.md](docs/android-memory.md): what reclaims the engine's memory on a phone.

## Prior art

This is an engineering package of ideas from AirLLM, Apple's *LLM in a flash*, FlexGen, PowerInfer
and EdgeMoE, not a novel technique. The closest recent work is
[flash-moe](https://github.com/danveloper/flash-moe): a purpose-built Metal engine that streams a
397B MoE from SSD on Apple Silicon, and on an iPhone through a community fork. BigMoeOnEdge takes
the other side of that problem: CPU-only, on Android, on llama.cpp's public API (bar one optional
~25-line hook, above), across architectures. See [docs/limitations.md](docs/limitations.md).
